What I'm doing currently:
I've always been a very hacky person by nature. Since I was a kid I've been taking things apart, improving designs and incrementally making a product I would personally use. Even till this day, I always see an improvement with the things I use every day and creating solutions for my own problems, or at least automate the more mundante tasks/maintenance of things. Having been in the software industry for the last few years, I can comfortably say I generally enjoy developing software, but making services and webpages is a generally cyclical and I'm starting to realize I love saying, "I made this!" I love seeing other people use the things I make. I'm trying to cross the border to get into hardware with software and hopefully find a position where I can truely be passionate.
