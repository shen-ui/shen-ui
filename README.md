- 👋 Hi, I’m @shen-ui
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Everything! I have tons of hobbies from running to stonks
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... typescript, SpringBoot
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything where I can learn something new (within programming ofc.)
- 📫 How to reach me ... peterhuiwang1995@gmail.com | BasedShen#1337 | @shen-ui


What I'm doing currently:
Currently working on upgrading my personal website as well as other misc. stuff. 
Honestly just having a chill time and enjoying learning new languages (positive reinforcement!) 
and implementing what I learned in my degree. Math and Algos only takes you so far..
I've always felt super confident about my data structures and algorithms but I never learned
how to do real world problems in my college career (i.g. front-end, back-end dev. api design etc.)
and I don't want to be a data engineer/analyst so I'm going to push myself towards the path
I want to travel. 

Add me on Discord if you want to get to me ASAP!
